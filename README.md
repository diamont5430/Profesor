To run the project from the command line, you either need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) installed on your local system (`mvn`) or you need to use the Maven wrapper (`mvnw`). You can then execute

	mvn clean install

to package and install the artifacts for the three subprojects. Afterwards, you can run ...

	cd server
	mvn spring-boot:run

to start the server or ...

	cd client
	mvn javafx:run

to run the client. Please note that the server needs to be running, before you can start the client.

Once this is working, you can try importing the project into your favorite IDE.
